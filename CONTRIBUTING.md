## Coding guidelines

**Testing**

As this is a simple script, unit tests are not required. Tests are done in the
way of automated gitlab builds.

**Style**

We feel that a unified coding style is important, which is why we require a linter to
be used. In this case **pep8** is used. Code must pass pep8's default tests.

**Documentation**

The script should be annotated using docstrings and comments where applicable
